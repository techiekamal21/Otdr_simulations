# Advanced OTDR Simulator

A professional-grade Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR) simulator built with React and TypeScript. This interactive tool simulates fiber optic testing with realistic physics, signal visualization, and comprehensive event analysis.

## Features

- **Real-time OTDR Trace Simulation** with accurate physics modeling
- **Interactive Event Management** - Add connectors, splices, bends, cuts, and degradation points
- **Signal Visualization** - Watch optical pulses travel through the fiber
- **Automatic Configuration** - Smart auto-mode for optimal test parameters
- **Zoom & Pan Controls** - Detailed trace analysis with interactive graph
- **Event Detection & Analysis** - Automatic identification of fiber events
- **Physics Panel** - Real-time calculations of pulse length, resolution, and dead zones
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile devices
