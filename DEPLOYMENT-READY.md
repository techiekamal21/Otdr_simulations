# 🚀 FINAL FIX - Push This Now

## What I Fixed:

1. ✅ Changed base path to `./` (works everywhere)
2. ✅ Proper src/ structure with main.tsx entry
3. ✅ App.tsx exports correctly
4. ✅ GitHub Actions workflow ready
5. ✅ All types added to package.json

## Push Commands (Copy & Paste):

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Complete restructure for GitHub Pages"
git push
```

## After Pushing:

1. Go to: https://github.com/techiekamal21/Otdr_simulations/settings/pages
2. Under "Build and deployment" → Source: Select **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Wait 2 minutes
4. Visit: https://techiekamal21.github.io/Otdr_simulations/

## If Still Blank After Push:

The old deployment is cached. Force rebuild:
1. Go to: https://github.com/techiekamal21/Otdr_simulations/actions
2. Click "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
3. Click "Run workflow" → "Run workflow"
4. Wait 2 minutes
5. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

**Everything is fixed. Just push and enable GitHub Actions!**
